# Automating Regulatory Alignment: A RAG-Based Architecture for Navigating ESRS E1 Climate Disclosures
The primary objective of this project is to develop a specialized AI tool designed to sup-
port sustainability teams in aligning their internal data with the ESRS E1 (Climate Change)
standard. The AI will function as a “Knowledge Assistant” that provides evidence-backed
answers to reporting queries by retrieving relevant passages from the ESRS E1 and gener-
ating grounded explanations through a RAG pipeline.
