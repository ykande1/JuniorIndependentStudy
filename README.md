# Automating Regulatory Alignment: A RAG-Based Architecture for Navigating ESRS E1 Climate Disclosures
The primary objective of this project is to develop a specialized AI tool designed to support sustainability teams in aligning their internal data with the ESRS E1 (Climate Change) standard. The AI will function as a “Knowledge Assistant” that provides evidence-backed answers to reporting queries by retrieving relevant passages from the ESRS E1 and the relevant EFRAG guidelines, generating grounded explanations through a RAG pipeline.
